# Wtc_deeplearning
Project for applying deep learning to answer elementary science questions, somehow using explanations provided in the world tree corpus. The world tree corpus dataset is a set of text based elementary science questions with hand crafted explanations.

Unprocessed dataset can be downloaded at http://cognitiveai.org/explanationbank/

The version I use here is the "with mercury" dataset, i.e. Worldtree_Explanation_Corpus_V1_Sept2017_withMercury.zip
After processing this dataset consists of 1663 examples.
