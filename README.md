Use deep learning on the world tree corpus dataset. The world tree corpus dataset is a set of text based elementary science questions with hand crafted explanations.

Unprocessed dataset can be downloaded at http://cognitiveai.org/explanationbank/

The version I use here is the with mercury dataset, i.e. Worldtree_Explanation_Corpus_V1_Sept2017_withMercury.zip
After processing this dataset consists of 1663 examples.
